Ozone Watch is designed to help users keep track of ozone concentrations reported during the current ozone season and understand the possible implications for attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone during the current 3-year design value period. The information in Ozone Watch is based on ozone concentration data reported to the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) database, combined with real-time ozone concentration data reported to the EPA's AirNow database on days where the data have not yet been submitted to AQS.

The ozone concentration data for the current ozone season are refreshed each morning, beginning on May 1st and continuing throughout the year. Ozone concentration data for prior years are retrieved from AQS and refreshed on a monthly basis.

This preliminary data is intended for informational use only. Data and figures obtained from Ozone Watch should NOT be used for regulatory or other official purposes.
